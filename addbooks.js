        "‘A supremely practical and useful book. James Clear distils the most fundamental information about habit formation, so you can accomplish more by focusing on less. ’ Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck________________________________People say when you want to change your life, you need to set big goals. But they’re wrong. World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a simpler system for transforming your life. He knows that lasting change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions – doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call. He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book, Clear reveals how these tiny changes will help you get 1 percent better every day. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone) and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs and distinguished scientists who have used the science of small habits to stay productive, motivated and happy. These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships and your life. ________________________________‘James Clear has spent years honing the art and studying the science of habits. This engaging, hands-on book is the guide you need to break bad routines and make good ones. ’ Adam Grant, author of Originals‘A special book that will change how you approach your day and live your life. ’ Ryan Holiday, author of The Obstacle is the Way",

          "bookdetails": "Every creation begins as a thought, from a symphony to a marriage to an ice cream cone to a rocket launch. When we have an intention, a complex chain of events begins in our brains. Thoughts travel as electrical impulses along neural pathways. When neurons fire together they wire together, creating electromagnetic fields. These fields are invisible energy, yet they influence the molecules of matter around us the way a magnet organizes iron filings. In Mind to Matter, award-winning researcher Dawson Church explains the science showing how our minds create matter. Different intentions produce different fields and different material creations. The thoughts and energy fields we cultivate in our minds condition the atoms and molecules around us. We can now trace the science behind each link in chain from thought to thing, showing the surprising ways in which our intentions create the material world. The science in the book is illustrated by many authentic case histories of people who harnessed the extraordinary power of the mind to create. They include:Adeline, whose Stage 4 cancer disappeared after she imagined “healing stars”Raymond Aaron and two of his clients, each of whom manifested $1 million in the same weekElon Musk, who bounced back from devastating tragedy to found Tesla and SpaceXGraham Phillips, who grew the emotional regulation part of his brain by 22. 8 percent in two monthsJennifer Graf, whose grandfather’s long-dead radio came to life to play love songs the day of her weddingHarold, whose 80 percent hearing loss reversed in an hourJoe Marana, whose deceased sister comforted him from beyond the graveRick Geggie, whose clogged arteries cleared up the night before cardiac surgeryMatthias Rust, a teen whose \"airplane flight for peace\" changed the fate of superpowersWanda Burch, whose dream about cancer told the surgeon exactly where to look for itAn MIT freshman student who can precipitate sodium crystals with his mindJohn, who found himself floating out of his body and returned to find his AIDS healedDean, whose cortisol levels dropped by 48 percent in a single hourIn Mind to Matter, Dawson Church shows that these outcomes aren’t a lucky accident only a few people experience. Neuroscientists have measured a specific brain wave formula that is linked to manifestation. This \"flow state\" can be learned and applied by anyone. New discoveries in epigenetics, neuroscience, electromagnetism, psychology, vibration and quantum physics connect each step in the process by which mind creates matter. They show that the whole universe is self-organizing and when our minds are in a state of flow, they coordinate with nature's emergent intelligence to produce synchronous outcomes. The book contained over 150 photos and illustrations that explain the process, while an \"Extended Play\" section at the end of each chapter provides additional resources. As Mind to Matter drops each piece of the scientific puzzle into place, it leaves us with a profound understanding of the enormous creative potential of our minds. It also gives us a road map to cultivating these remarkable brain states in our daily lives.",

The difficulty, however, is that instead of using the mind as a helpful servant we have largely allowed it to become the master of our lives. Its ambitions, belief systems, and interpretations rule our days and our nights―bringing us into conflict with minds that are different from ours, keeping us awake at night rehashing those conflicts or planning the conflicts of tomorrow, and disturbing our sleep and our dreams. If only there was a way to switch it off and give it a rest! Finding the switch that can silence the mind―not by force or performing some exotic ritual, but through understanding, watchfulness, and a healthy sense of humor―is meditation. A sharper, more relaxed and creative mind―one that can function at the peak of its unique intelligence―is the potential. The book includes a link to tutorials on OSHO Nadabrahma Meditation.Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the Sunday Times of London as one of the “1000 Makers of the 20th Century” and by Sunday Mid-Day (India) as one of the ten people―along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha―who have changed the destiny of India.

India has unmatched talent and ambition with an inherent tendency to work hard, then what is it that keeps India from overtaking the world. Why does India as a nation settle for the ordinary when the extraordinary is well within the reach? Dr. Kalam shares his dream of a nation that is unrivaled, he discusses how he has, from his experience, met such skilled people whose visions can transform the nation. It is imperative that one searches for own solutions and find role-models in countrymen instead of looking towards the other nations. India must not strive to be the next America or Japan but has to be the strong nation that she is capable of becoming. For this, all the trapped energies and initiatives need to be freed instead of suppressing them. In the book, we are introduced to numerous role models that are hiding amongst us. Words of wisdom from saints and seers that the author encountered through his life have been quoted. The book proceeds to address the issues at hand and mentions some reforms that have to be incorporated in politics and policies. The policy making procedure of the nation requires major reforms. The youth has to be given a stage and the reins of the nation need to be passed on. The book motivates the young minds and forces the positive auras together to build the face of a new nation.

  "bookdetails": "That was the point at which I knew that the transition from being a strong player to becoming a champion wasn't going to happen on its own. I had to want it ardently enough. Doing everything admirably well matters very little if you can't finish the job.'Few people know better than Viswanathan Anand how to tackle the gravest obstacles and overcome the toughest odds. From the time he learnt to move pieces on a chess board as a six-year-old, Vishy- as Anand is fondly known - has racked up innumerable accolades. The first chess Grandmaster from Asia, he emerged onto the world stage when chess was largely a Soviet preserve, climbed the ranks to become world No. 1, bagged five world championship titles and won tournaments across all formats of the game. An ambassador of the sport like no other, his is one of the most revered names in chess today. In Mind Master, Vishy looks back at a lifetime of games played, opponents tackled and circumstances overcome and draws from its depths significant tools that will help every reader to navigate life's challenges. * What role do tactics and strategy play in the preparation for achieving a goal? * How can emotions be harnessed to be of advantage in tricky situations? * What are the precautions to be taken before you decide to leave your comfort zone and embrace risk? * What do you need to do to stay relevant in the face of rapidly changing realities? * Is unlearning really the only way to learn? These are just some of the nuggets Anand touches upon with characteristic wit, easy wisdom and disarming candour in Mind Master - a delightful and invaluable exploration into the self that will thrill, inspire and motivate readers as few books have done before.",

He supports many charitable causes, chief among them being that of children with cerebral palsy and other neurological disabilities."

In Yuktahaar, celebrity nutritionist Munmun Ganeriwal argues that the reason why none of the diets in the past have seemed to work is because they focused on the wrong cause-you, the reader. While we may continue to have a fling with low carb, vegan, low fat diets and everything in between but a long-lasting solution may never be found if we do not shift our focus from 'you' to 'them'-the human-gut microbiome connection. Nearly all chronic issues are rooted in an imbalanced microbiome. Disruption in the balance of your belly-based microscopic community not only causes weight gain and increases the risk of chronic diseases but also impacts our mood, behavior, happiness, and a general sense of well-being. In this book, Munmun gives an actionable 10-week holistic program that encourages a gut balancing lifestyle, consisting of season-wise meal plans, recipes, exercise routines, sleep hygiene tips, and yoga practice. The book also charts actress Taapsee Pannu's phenomenal physical transformation while working with Munmun. With a focus on combining traditional, regional Indian foods with evidence-backed tips, Yuktahaar will transform your relationship with food and rebalance your gut for a leaner and healthier you.",
